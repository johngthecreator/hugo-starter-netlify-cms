        <!-- <p>I’m passionate about programming and fascinated with the digital infrastructure that society has created. It’s undeniable that the digital infrastructure we’ve created has become such an integral part of our lives. Resulting from it’s essential nature, it’s important that we educate individuals on the proper usage and composition of our existing digital infrastructure. I believe anyone can code! I love teaching others about the simplicity and elegance of programming. It’s especially gratifying to see what individuals are able to make with just a few lines of code. Programming is empowering and provides individuals with the power to change the world.</p> -->
